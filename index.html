<p>The term summer vacation or summer break refers to a school break in the summer between school years and the break in the school academic year. Students believe that it is a time of pure bliss and freedom, free from the confines of schoolwork. Students are off anywhere between two weeks to three and a half months. Depending on the country and district, staff might be partially or fully excluded.</p>
