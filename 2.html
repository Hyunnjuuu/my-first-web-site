<h2>Plan</h2>
<p>Once you figure out why you want to code, you can more easily pinpoint which programming language you should tackle. While there is no single “best” programming language to learn, some languages are more user-friendly than others. HTML and CSS are considered the easiest entry points into the coding world, but they are only really useful for developing basic websites. For more interactive websites involving payment systems or databases, you’ll need to know languages like Javascript, PHP, SQL, and Python. Mobile app makers use Swift or C to make iOS apps, and Java or Kotlin for Android apps. Video game developers may turn to Unity or even C# to bring their games to life.</p>
